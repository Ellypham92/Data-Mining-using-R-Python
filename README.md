# Data-Mining-using-R-Python
This folder is for practices with small datasets and large datasets. I am applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques such as k-NN, Naive Bayes, k-Means Clustering, Decision Tree, Random Forest, ANN, SVM, etc. The tools that I am using here are R and Python.
