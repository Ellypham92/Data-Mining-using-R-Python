# Data-Mining-using-R-Python
This folder is for practices with small data sets and large data sets. I will be applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques such as k-NN, Naive Bayes, k-Means Clustering, Decision Tree, Random Forest, ANN, SVM, etc. The tools that I am using here are R and Python.
